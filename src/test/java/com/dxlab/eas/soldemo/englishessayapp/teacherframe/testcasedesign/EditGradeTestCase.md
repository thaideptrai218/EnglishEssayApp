# Test Plan: `editGrade()` Method ‚Äì `TeacherFrame.java`

## ‚úÖ Objective

The purpose of this test plan is to verify the correctness and robustness of the `editGrade()` method in `TeacherFrame.java`. This method allows teachers to modify existing grades for a specific essay in the `graded.txt` file.

## üõ† Test Environment

- **Test Framework**: JUnit 5
- **Test Style**: File-based testing using `@TempDir` for isolation
- **UI Dependency**: Uses `JTable` for simulating row selections

## üìå Notes

- The method does not return a value, so verification is done via file inspection (`graded.txt` content).
- If the method includes dialog interactions, mocking (e.g., `DialogManager`) is recommended to prevent GUI blocking.
- Be sure the essay ID, student ID, and topic ID match exactly in the test data to ensure a successful match during edit.
